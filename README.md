Inventory Management is a software program developed to facilitate the management of serialized inventory for businesses. This application is specifically tailored for businesses that utilize stock with unique serial numbers. The implemented features allow the user to efficiently add, search, view, change location, and delete stock from the system. These capabilities prove particularly valuable to businesses that install equipment in various locations and rely on engineering services to do so, as the program enables them to keep track of the precise location of each item.
